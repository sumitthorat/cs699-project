Lightweight Restaurant Management System is a software system which aims to digitise the order management process at restaurants whilst being very light, inexpensive and user friendly. It does so by enabling the restaurant staff to make use of an Android app to view orders, edit menu, manage tables and view statistics. IT allows placing orders using a webapp which can be accessed via a table specific QR code.
